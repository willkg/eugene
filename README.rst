 About eugene
==============

eugene is a *really* basic chat system I built to use with `Artemis
<http://www.artemis.eochu.com/>`_ to act as a text-based comms system.

It's got two parts:

1. backend is a really stripped down Flask-based web application that
   has a REST API that does some basic message and participant
   handling

2. HTML5 frontend for "signing in", sending, receiving and handling
   messages
